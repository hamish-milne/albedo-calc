# Albedo Combat Calculator

This is a little app to assist with running the infamously-complex combat rules for the Albedo TTRPG.

It can be accessed [here](https://hamish-milne.github.io/albedo-calc/), or you can download [the HTML bundle](/docs/index.html) and run it locally.

It has:

- character sheets
- built-in and custom weapons and armour
- a drag-and-drop map grid for range calculations
- both automatic and manual dice rolling
- a combat log

All data is saved to Local Storage, but you can save everything to a JSON file and load it back later with the Export dialog at the bottom.
